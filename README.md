# GeoFS-Aircraft-Changes

This changes a few aircraft to have things like reverse thrust or better performance.

To run this, copy *Aircraft improvements.js* and paste it into the console.

To run this as a bookmarklet, you follow the following procedure:

- Copy the code of *Bookmarklet.js*
- Click the little star icon at the right end of your search bar to make a bookmark
- Click "more"
- Type "GeoFS Aircraft Improvements" in the "Name" box
- Paste the code into the "URL" space
- Click "save"
- Click the bookmark when running GeoFS to run it.

If the bookmarks bar is not visible when playing GeoFS, right click any bookmark and click "Show bookmarks bar" at the very bottom of the popup menu.

There are a number of other GeoFS addons that can be run as bookmarklets, so it is recommended to make a bookmarks folder of GeoFS addons if you are planning on using multiple of them.
