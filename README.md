# GeoFS-Aircraft-Changes

This changes a few aircraft and also adds Mach effects. If you want to know what aircraft are affected by the changes half, check the comments in the code. Mach effects will show up as progressively worsening turbulence as airspeed increases.

Note that this is designed using the 3.0 beta's weather engine, meaning it may not work in 2.9. Other features may also break in 2.9.

To run this, copy the code and paste it into the console.
