# GeoFS-Aircraft-Changes

This changes a few aircraft and also adds Mach effects. If you want to know what aircraft are affected by the changes half, check the comments in the code. Mach effects will show up as progressively worsening turbulence as airspeed increases beyond the aircraft's critical Mach (0.675 for straight wing and 0.8 for swept).

Note that this is designed using the 3.0 beta's weather engine, meaning it may not work in 2.9. Other features may also break in 2.9.

To run this, copy *Aircraft changes.js* and paste it into the console.

To run this as a bookmarklet, you follow the following procedure:

- Copy the code of *Bookmarklet.js*

- Click "more"
- Type "GeoFS Aircraft Improvements" in the "Name" box

If the bookmarks bar is not visible when playing GeoFS, right click any bookmark and click "Show bookmarks bar" at the very bottom of the popup menu.

There are a number of other GeoFS addons that can be run as bookmarklets, so it is recommended to make a bookmarks folder of GeoFS addons if you are planning on using multiple of them.
